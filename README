Installation Instructions

1: ./autogen.sh

2: ./configure (--prefix=where you want it to be installed if not /usr/local/bin)

3: make (-jN, where N is the number of threads supported by your cpu, for a parallel build)

4: make install (as a superuser, if needed)

now you can delete the source files (rm -r .)
